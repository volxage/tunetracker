Tune Tracker
============

This is the BeeWare (via Python) implementation of the program. The benefit of this approach is that after some minimal configuration the program can be packaged for Android, iOS, MacOS, Windows, and Linux! The downside is that the code needs to be very general and high-level. It needs to be so generic, in fact, that searching tunes and using large lists of tunes would require directly modifying the Beeware library, which is beyond the scope of the project. This is why this implementation was dropped.
