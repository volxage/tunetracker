Tune Tracker ncurses
===
This is a CLI implementation of Tune Tracker, which can run comfortably on most terminals using ncurses. There are some problems opening and closing columns on this app that will need to be fixed before this implementation can be recommended. Until then, try the BeeWare implementation!
