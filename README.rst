Tune Tracker
===
Tune Tracker is a new cross-platform application designed to help musicians (specifically jazz musicians) keep track of the tunes they need to practice more, and contrarily the tunes they are ready to perform. It does this by allowing the user to input their "confidence" in a given song after playing or practicing it, and then the program keeps track of this data. The program then allows the user to sort the songs by how well they know certain aspects of the song such as form, melody, rhythm, and lyrics. The user can also attach notable recordings to a tune, such that if they need to re-learn it, they can look up the reference recording to see how that performer played the song in that particular recording.
Instead of needing to manually type out the title and composers of a song, they can instead search for the song on a list that was generated by JazzStandards.com.
I have some lofty goals for the future of this project. I want to add the ability to graph a tune's confidence over time, which would require storing confidence entries along with a time stamp. I would also like to improve the list items in the editor, allowing a separate field for each item and a plus button to add a new item to the list. I would also eventually like to create an online database of tunes, composers, notable recordings (and links to them from each streaming service), common keys and tempos, and tips and tricks on how to learn specific tunes. This would ultimately require the project to be profitable, as the server wouldn't be free and the process of maintaining and updating this database would look more like a job than a hobby project.
The most prepared version of the project lies in the BeeWare implementation which will likely be packaged for app stores, while the other implementations were more experimental and have a lot of platform-specific problems.
Happy tracking!
