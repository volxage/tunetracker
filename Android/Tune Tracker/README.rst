Tune Tracker Android
===
This implementation is redundant because the BeeWare implementation will package for Android. There are some interesting problems with switching menus and dealing with Java's type-rigidity and over-verbosity. However this was a great development experience to learn how Android apps are made and get some more experience with Java. I may revisit this to get some more specific UI, or maybe even integrate something with the BeeWare code.
